          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>I am a second year student pursuing a Btech degree in Computer Science and Business Systems at Heritage Institute of Technology, 
            Kolkata. I have very recntly picked up coding for web development. I am currently learning Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. 
          </p>

          <p>I have about 6 years of programming experience with Java, 2 with both C and Python. Due to the immense number of fields available in 
            the sector that I study in, there is more than just one side that I would like to pick. However, right now I have my heart on web 
            dev.</p>

          <p>I would say I am a pretty fun and frank person. Feel free to have a little chat with me over any of my socials.</p>
